# MTG-Stuff
Holds various random MTG things I made

Character generator:
  
  Generates a random MTG character that might or might not be plausible within MTG.
  
  When entering a number, please enter it in as an integer (ex. 5, 6, 8, 10) and not a string (ex. Forty, twenty, nine, three)
  
Planeswalker Generator:
  
  Generates a random planeswalker that might or might not be plausible within MTG. It generates a race(goblin, viashino, human, etc), a      gender (male, female, or other), and magic colors (white & red, blue, Green & black & red, etc.)
  
  When entering a number, please enter it in as an integer (ex. 5, 6, 8, 10) and not a string (ex. Forty, twenty, nine, three)

Deck builder:

  Things that cause an error:
    
    Trying to edit a .dek file that doesn't exist
    
    Typing a string instead of a number when adding cards to a deck
    
    Various other things

I reccomend downloading a python compiler to run these programs, as they display quite a bit in the console.
